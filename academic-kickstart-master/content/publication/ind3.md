**Original name:** Оптимальное оценивание состояний полусинхронного потока событий второго порядка при непродлевающемся мертвом времени.

**Abstract:**

We solve the optimal estimation problem for the states of a semi-synchronous events flow of the second order. We consider the stationary operation mode of the flow in conditions of an unextendable dead time, i.e. after each registered event at the moment tk, there is a dead time period of fixed duration T, during which other events of the considered flow are inaccessible to observation. At the end of the dead time period, the first event that occurred again creates a period of dead time, etc. The optimal estimation of states is performed using the maximum method of a posteriori probability.
