**Abstract:**

We consider the optimal estimation problem for the states of a semi-synchronous event flow of the second order with two states; it is one of the adequate mathematical models for an incoming stream of claims (events) in modern digital integral servicing networks, telecommunication systems, satellite communication networks. We find an explicit form for posterior probabilities of the flow states. The decision about the flow state is made with the maximal a posteriori criterion.
