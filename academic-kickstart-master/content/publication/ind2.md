**Abstract:**

We consider a correlated semi-synchronous event ﬂow of the second order with two states; it is one of the mathematical models for an incoming stream of claims (events) in modern digital integral servicing networks, telecommunication systems and satellite communication networks. We solve the problem of estimating the probability density parameters of the values of the interval duration between the moments of the events occurrence by the method of moments for general and special cases of setting the ﬂow parameters. The results of statistical experiment performed on a ﬂow simulation model are given.
