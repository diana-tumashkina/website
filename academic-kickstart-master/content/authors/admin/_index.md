Interested in Data Analysis, Analytics and Data Science, I am currently a last year master student in the EISTI Master's program "Quantitative Finance and Risk Management".

I graduated from the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Cybernetics, I have a master’s degree in "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science" and a bachelor's degree in "Mathematical Methods in Economics".

For 5 years I was engaged in mathematical research, as a result of which I have 12 scientific publications in areas of applied probabilistic analysis and queueing theory (3 of them are indexed in Scopus and 1 in Web of Science).
