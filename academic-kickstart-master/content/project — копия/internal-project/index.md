In this research project, semi-synchronous event flow of the second order was investigated. It is one of the doubly stochastic event flows (point process). This point process was considered under conditions of its complete and uncomplete observability. The following problems were solved: states estimation of the event flow and flow parameters estimation. The explicit analytical formulas were derived.
